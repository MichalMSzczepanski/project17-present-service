todo:
  - in receipt manually create id, instead of automatic generation (the s3 will have the same key thanks to that)
    - done, now manually test if one receipt with one aws image is created per presentIdea / presentPurchased
    - clean up ReceiptService
  - add fetching presentsPurchased by personId
  - job for cleaning s3 images without parent entities (S3CleanupScheduler)
  - when converting a presentIdea to presentPurchased add option for adding another image (pic of present) (make sure only one can be added per entity)
  - check if s3 updates photo for present (allowed one photo) - /v1/present/receipt
  - finish S3CleanupScheduler
  - create receipt broken in delete old photo moment (file name should be uppdated, it isnt') ???
  - update creating receipt with unique constraint in database on presentId
  - manual test receipt crud and what happens in aws
  - create mockito tests for s3
  - create S3CleanupService to check periodically if there are any images in the db which do not have corresponding receipt entities
  - create screenshot per present one to many entity with s3 persistance
  - move @Value to a bean in all cases
  - move aws credentials and details to properties library
  - check aws credentials and general config local/prod
  - move MAX_FILE_SIZE to property
  - user needs endpoint to cancel further reminders for specific occasion
  - add images of present receipts (blob in postgres? s3 on localstack?)
  - update notification for occasion with current ideas for present
  - update notification with link to presents already purchased
  - update Present with custom categories for each user
  - upon creating entities, fetch OWNER from usercontext, don't allow declarative setting of field "owner"
  - switch to testcontainers with embedded redis? might fix tests
  - endpoints tests
  - fix spring context & add assertions to ReminderDateCacheProcessorIntegrationTest
    - introduce external library configuration
  - add controller read-only for checking redis pojo with reminders

wishlist:
  - gcp instead of aws for images
  - sms with notification
  - graphql
