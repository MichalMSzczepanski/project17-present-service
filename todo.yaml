logic:
  - case 1:
    - create reminder about wife's birthday:
        - 30 april
        - remind vie email 2 weeks prior at 9:00, 1 week prior at 9:00, 1 day prior at 9:00
        -
semantics:
  - occasion, reminder relationships with person (bidirectional):
      - scenarios:
          - i want to save an occasion to a person id
          - i want to save a reminder to an occasion id
  - entities with relationships - person, occasion, present + reminders about occasions:
      - person has (one to many) occasions that have reminders (one to many)
      - person has present(s) gifted (one to many)
      - occasion has present ideas (one to many)
      - present idea once purchased is substituted by present gifted:
          - present gifted is associated with person AND occasion:
              - when person is deleted, all occasions nad presents are deleted
              - when occasion is deleted, presents gifted are not deleted (specific cascade!)
