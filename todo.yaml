logic:
  - user needs endpoint to cancel further reminders for specific occasion
  - add images of present receipts (blob in postgres? s3 on localstack?)
  - update notification for occasion with current ideas for present
  - update notification with link to presents already purchased
  - update Present with custom categories for each user
  - sms with notification
semantics:
  - upon creating entities, fetch OWNER from usercontext, don't allow declarative setting of field "owner"
  - switch to testcontainers with embedded redis? might fix tests
  - endpoints tests
  - fix spring context & add assertions to ReminderDateCacheProcessorIntegrationTest
    - introduce external library configuration
  - add controller read-only for checking redis pojo with reminders
